PS: This isn't quite ready yet, there are still some bugs 🐛. We're working on improving it asap.

## 🎯 Game Story

Earth is under siege by alien invaders. Military defenses have collapsed and intercontinental missiles threaten total annihilation. The White House has fallen.

**Your Mission**: Pilot Air Force One to rescue the President and transport him to a safe fortress. Fly under fire from the alien stellar fleet, dodge hostile missiles, and break free from the wreckage of Washington D.C. Your mission is to fly to the designated safe zone to coordinate a counter-offensive.

Failure to escape means the President will be lost and Earth's last hope will end. **The fate of humanity depends on this evacuation.**

*"In God We Trust"* - Your courage is humanity's last hope.

## 🎯 How to Play

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ↑ | Move plane down |
| ↓ | Move plane up |
| ← | Move plane left |
| → | Move plane right |
| A | Increase speed |
| Z | Decrease speed |

### Game Mechanics

#### Flight System
- **Speed Control**: Balance speed for optimal fuel consumption and maneuverability
- **Altitude Management**: Navigate through different flight levels to avoid threats
- **Physics-Based Movement**: Realistic aircraft response to player inputs

#### Fuel Management
- **Fuel Consumption**: Monitor your fuel gauge constantly
- **Aerial Refueling**: Connect with tanker aircraft when fuel is low (≤98%)
- **Refueling Process**: Position your aircraft precisely behind the tanker
- **Fuel Limitations**: Running out of fuel ends your mission

#### Enemy System
- **Alien Spaceships**: Dodge various types of hostile alien vessels
- **Missiles**: Avoid incoming projectiles and hostile fire

### Aerial Refueling Guide

1. **Tanker Approach**: A refueling tanker will approach when your fuel is low
2. **Positioning**: Fly directly behind the tanker aircraft
3. **Connection**: Maintain precise position within the refueling zone
4. **Refueling**: Fuel will automatically transfer when properly connected
5. **Completion**: Tanker departs when refueling is complete or times out
